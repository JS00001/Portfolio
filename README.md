## üöÄ Problem
Recruiters want to see applicants' work and projects. I had not yet created a website to show off my work in a flashy way.


## ‚ù§Ô∏è The Solution
My portfolio was created to show off my previously made projects, my planning process, some facts about me, and provide an easy way to contact me. 


## üî® Setup
- Make sure you have `NodeJS` installed.
- Clone this project
- Open a command prompt in the projects folder, and run `npm install`
- Once the installation has completed, run `npm run dev` to run the application in developer mode.
- Navigate to https://localhost:3000
